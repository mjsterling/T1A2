## Purpose

This project is a personal portfolio website intended to be delivered as part of the T1A2 assessment for Coder Academy.
In addition to this, I intend it to be used and updated throughout my career as a software engineer as a compact representation of my skills, abilities, and personality.

## Functionality/Features

The website consists of five HTML documents interlinked by a navigation bar. In order to save valuable screen real estate on mobile and engage the user, it features a clean, fun and interactive design based on a deck of cards, wherein the user move the cards on the page to toggle between the title of the page or a menu, using navigation arrows or drag/swipe gestures.

The site also features:
- Click-to-call and click-to-email buttons;
- 100% resizable responsiveness within an approximate aspect ratio range of 1/3 to 8/3;
- An optional dark mode that uses `localStorage` to persist between pages;
